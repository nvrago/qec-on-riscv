# Quantum Error Correction on RISC-V

A simulation-based project demonstrating simple quantum error-correcting codes (e.g. 3-qubit bit-flip and phase-flip) executed in a RISC-V simulation environment.

## Features
- Implements basic QEC algorithms.
- Performance benchmarks on RISC-V simulation.
- Modular educational framework for extending to higher-order quantum simulations.

## Getting Started
Instructions coming soon.
